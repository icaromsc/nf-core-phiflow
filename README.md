## Introduction

**nf-core/phiflow** is a bioinformatics pipeline that simultaneously characterize the microbial composition and host gene expression RNA sequencing samples. Given a list of samples from raw reads as input data (FASTQ) the pipeline performs several steps to produce two data matrices: Host gene expression matrix and Microbial composition matrix. These data matrices can help researchers to investigate the host transcriptome response under the presence of identified microbes and the association of microbial presence with specific host gene modules.


<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction
-->

![phiflow Overview](docs/images/workflow_pipeline_2023_updated.png)

<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Read QC ([`fastp`](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp))
2. Read alignment to the human host genome ([`STAR`](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR))
3. Infer library strandedness ([`RSeQC`](https://rseqc.sourceforge.net/))
4. Quantify host gene expression ([`subread:featureCounts`](https://github.com/ShiLab-Bioinformatics/subread))
5. Taxonomic profiling of host unmapped reads ([`Kraken2`](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/))
6. Calculate confidence scores from Kraken2 taxonomic profiling ([`Conifer`](https://github.com/ivarz/conifer))
7. Present summary of all previous processing steps ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Usage

> **Note**
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how
> to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline)
> with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,fastq_1,fastq_2
CONTROL_REP1,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz,AEG588A1_S1_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz
```

Each row represents a fastq file (single-end) or a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/phiflow \
   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> **Warning:**
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those
> provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/phiflow/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/phiflow/parameters).
